# The cd Command
## With No Arguments
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ pwd
/home/lecture1
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ pwd
/home
```
Before the command was run my working directory was `/home/lecture1`. 
Running the command produced no outputs, however it changed my working directory to `/home`.
When no arguments are given, the `cd` command changes your working directory to `/home`.




```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ ls
Hello.class  Hello.java  messages  README
```
