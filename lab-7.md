**Keys Pressed:**
git<space>clone<space><ctrl + v><enter>

**Command(s) Ran:**
`git clone git@github.com:loganbledsoe/lab7.git`

**Notes:**
The url for the Github repository was on my clipboard, so I used ctrl + v (paste) to access it.

## Step 6

**Keys Pressed:**
cd<space>l<tab><enter>
bash<space>t<tab><enter>

**Command(s) Ran:**
`cd lab7/`
`bash test.sh`

**Notes:**
Within the home directory there was only one file/directory that began with an `l`, `lab7/` and within the `lab7/` directory there was only one file that began with a `t`, `test.sh`. So, instead of typing these two paths/files out, I used tab autocomplete, only tying their first letters then hitting tab, to get each path/file for the commands.

## Step 7
